# BIOENG 1320
This respository contains MATLAB projects I completed as a part of BIOENG 1320: Biosignals and Systems taught by Dr. Ramakrishna Mukkamala at the University of Pittsburgh. Opening any of the folders will yield the assignment description in the README.md file, the completed MATLAB code to run, the write-up with plots from the code, and answers to any questions in the assignment.
